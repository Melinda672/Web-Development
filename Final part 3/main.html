			<h1>Basic Information</h1>
            <p>Some basic information about myself is that I am the youngest of four siblings. I have a passion for video games, music and most recently computers. All three of these avenues have played an essential part in my life, building my character. Interacting with computers has always been something I’m interested in, specifically computer programming or web development. Computers are a part of everyday life and are something that isn’t going away any time soon. This makes me believe people should have a basic understanding and skill set for computers. For me finally being able to code my websites was a feeling I didn’t know I would genuinely enjoy so much. Coding is a meticulous job, with a single space, letter, or number could affect the result of the entire page. It gives you a real sense of accomplishment from putting all that hard work into a project.</p>
